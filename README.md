# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend setup)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m virtualenv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   
    On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

5. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

1. Start the Django server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Python and Node.js/npm installed on your system.
- Make sure to activate the virtual environment (`venv`) before installing Python dependencies.
- Modify `<repository_url>` and `<project_directory>` to match your project setup.
- Update the frontend setup instructions (`npm i`) if your project includes frontend dependencies.
